# RotbeYar

## 📌 Overview

RotbeYar is an Android application built to demonstrate scalable architecture principles and modular project structure.  
The project focuses on clean separation of concerns, maintainability, testability, and structured feature implementation.

This repository is designed to showcase how a real-world Android project can be structured using modern architectural patterns while keeping the codebase clean, modular, and scalable.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as an architecture showcase project rather than a fully completed production application.  
It demonstrates how features should be structured, organized, and implemented in a scalable Android project following Clean Architecture principles.

The goal of this project is to reflect strong engineering decisions, clear separation of concerns, and maintainable code structure rather than feature quantity.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

RotbeYar follows a layered architecture approach inspired by Clean Architecture principles combined with the MVVM pattern.  
The project is structured to enforce strict separation of concerns and improve scalability, readability, and long-term maintainability.

The architecture is divided into the following layers:

---

## 🖥 Presentation Layer (`presentation/`)

Responsible for UI and user interaction.

### Contains:
- Activities / Fragments
- ViewModels
- UI state handling (LiveData / Flow)
- User input validation
- Navigation logic

### Responsibilities:
- Observes state from ViewModel
- Sends user actions to UseCases
- Handles lifecycle-aware data observation
- Does **NOT** directly communicate with the Data layer

This layer depends only on the Domain layer.

---

## 🧠 Domain Layer (`domain/`)

Responsible for business logic and core application rules.

### Contains:
- Use Cases (each feature has its own dedicated use case class)
- Core business models
- Repository interfaces

### Example of Use Case usage:
- `LoginUseCase` handles authentication logic independently of UI and data sources.
- `FetchUserProfileUseCase` retrieves user data via domain repository interfaces.
- `SendMessageUseCase` handles chat message sending logic.
- `ObserveMessagesUseCase` manages real-time message observation.

### Key Characteristics:
- Completely independent from Android framework classes
- No dependency on Firebase SDK or external libraries
- Fully testable
- Encapsulates business rules in isolated classes

The Domain layer defines interfaces that are implemented inside the Data layer.

---

## 💾 Data Layer (`data/`)

Responsible for data management and implementation details.

### Contains:
- Repository implementations
- Data sources (local / remote / mock / Firebase)
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Mapping logic between DTOs and domain models

### Responsibilities:
- Implements interfaces defined in the Domain layer
- Communicates with Firebase and other data sources
- Handles data transformation and mapping
- Isolates external SDKs from the rest of the application

All Firebase-specific logic exists only in this layer to preserve architectural boundaries.

---

## 🔥 Firebase Integration

The project includes a Firebase-powered real-time chat module implemented as a proof of concept.

This feature demonstrates how external services can be integrated without breaking Clean Architecture principles.

### Firebase is used for:
- Real-time message synchronization
- Remote data handling
- Demonstrating scalable feature integration

### Architecture Flow for Chat:

Presentation → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository Interface → Repository Implementation → Firebase Data Source

The UI layer does **NOT** directly communicate with Firebase.  
All interactions are routed through Domain UseCases and Repository abstractions.

### This ensures:
- Proper separation of concerns
- Testable business logic
- Scalable architecture
- Isolation of external SDK dependencies

---

## 🧩 Dependency Injection (`di/`)

Responsible for dependency management and component wiring.

### Contains:
- Modules for providing dependencies
- Repository bindings
- UseCase provisioning
- Application-level dependency configuration

### Benefits:
- Loose coupling
- Improved testability
- Clear dependency graph
- Easier scalability and maintainability

---

## 🛠 Utilities (`utils/`)

Contains reusable helper classes and utility functions used across the project.

### Examples:
- Input validation utilities
- Extension functions
- Common helper methods

---

## 🧩 Implemented Features

- Login Screen with input validation
- Domain Use Cases for login and user profile
- Repository pattern for data handling
- Dependency Injection (DI) setup
- Firebase real-time chat module
- Utilities for reusable functions

---

## 🧠 Engineering Decisions

- **Clean Architecture:** Ensures separation of concerns and long-term maintainability
- **MVVM Pattern:** Provides structured communication between UI and business logic
- **Use Cases:** Encapsulate business rules independently from UI and data sources
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data sources and improves scalability
- **Dependency Injection:** Decouples components and enables easier testing
- **External SDK Isolation:** Firebase implementation is restricted to the Data layer

---
